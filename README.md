* [Use](#use)
	* [Internal WebView](#internal-webview)
	* [External Browser](#external-browser)

## Setup

The [OAuth Provider](https://www.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/45261909) portlet must be installed on your Liferay Portal in order to enable authentication with OAuth1. This portlet is currently available for EE customers only.

Read its [documentation](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/oauth) to generate the consumer key and secret for your app, they will be used by the Mobile SDK to sign your requests and we will refer to them in this document.

In your Android project, you need to add the library as a dependency, in the build.gradle file:

```groovy
repositories {
	jcenter()
	mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
	compile group: 'com.liferay.mobile', name: 'liferay-android-oauth', version: '1.+'
}
```

## Use

Create a `Session` instance passing a `OAuth` instance:

```java
import com.liferay.mobile.android.auth.Authentication;
import com.liferay.mobile.android.oauth.OAuth;

Authentication auth = new OAuth(consumerKey, consumerSecret, token, tokenSecret);
Session session = new SessionImpl("http://localhost:8080", auth);

GroupService service = new GroupService(session);
JSONArray sites = service.getUserSites();
```

As you can see, you need to pass `consumerKey` and `consumerSecret` to the `OAuth` constructor. These parameters are tied to your app and, as mentioned earlier, must be generated by the [OAuth Provider](https://dev.liferay.com/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/6-2/oauth) portlet.

`token` and `tokenSecret` are the tokens required by the **OAuth 1.0a protocol**. They are used to identify the user once he has granted permission to your app. In order to obtain them, the user needs to authenticate through the OAuth flow, that is, your app must open a web browser showing the portal's login page and user needs to login and grant permission to your app.

You can implement that part yourself, using any available Android OAuth 1.0a library. Alternatively, we provide helper classes to obtain `token` and `tokenSecret`. See the sections below.

### OAuth 2.0

This library only support **OAuth 1.0a protocol**. If you are using Liferay DXP 7.1 and want to use OAuth2 instead, you can do this through **[Liferay Mobile SDK 7.1](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-mobile-sdk) that already support OAuth 2.0 protocol**

#### Internal WebView

The instructions below give you an idea of the required steps to authenticate using an internal WebView in your app. It's very important that you read and run the [sample app](sample-webview/src/main/java/com/liferay/mobile/sample/activity/MainActivity.java).

Create a `OAuthWebView` instance within your app layout XML file:

```xml
<com.liferay.mobile.android.oauth.view.OAuthWebView
	android:id="@+id/webView"
	android:layout_width="match_parent"
	android:layout_height="match_parent" />
```

Then, start the OAuth flow by setting up your `OAuthWebView` instance with an `OAuthConfig` instance that contains the server URL, consumer key and secret, like the following:

```java
OAuthConfig config = new OAuthConfig(server, consumerKey, consumerSecret);
OAuthWebView webView = (OAuthWebView)findViewById(R.id.webView);
webView.start(config, this);
```

If everything goes fine, the WebView will open Liferay's login page and will ask the credentials to the user.

As you may have noticed, the start method also requires a `OAuthCallback` parameter, the callback's `onSuccess` method will be called once user has sucessfully authenticated and granted permission to your app, if he hasn't granted or something went wrong, `onFailure` will be called instead:

```java
@Override
public void onSuccess(OAuthConfig config) {
	String consumerKey = config.getConsumerKey();
	String consumerSecret = config.getConsumerSecret();
	String token = config.getToken();
	String tokenSecret = config.getTokenSecret();
	
	// Create an OAuth instance with these values and pass to
	// the SessionImpl constructor
}

@Override
public void onFailure(Exception exception) {
	exception.printStackTrace();
}	
```

The `onSuccess` config parameter provides all 4 values required by `SessionImpl` to authenticate against Liferay's remote services. Read the [use](#use) section above to learn how use the Mobile SDK's  services with these values.

The `OAuthCallback` interface also requires you to implement a `onCallbackURL` method, it's called when the authentication flow is completed and it's useful in case you want to hide the `OAuthWebView` instance:

```java
@Override
public void onCallbackURL(Uri callbackURL) {
	OAuthWebView webView = (OAuthWebView)findViewById(R.id.webView);
	webView.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);
}
```
#### External Browser

The instructions below give you an idea of the required steps to authenticate using an external browser. It's very important that you read and run the [sample app](sample-browser/src/main/java/com/liferay/mobile/sample/activity/MainActivity.java).

This will open the user's favorite mobile browser and the authentication flow will happen there as opposed to inside the app.

From your `Activity` you must start the `OAuthActivity`, passing a `OAuthConfig` instance as an intent extra:

```java
OAuthConfig config = new OAuthConfig(server, consumerKey, consumerSecret);
Intent intent = new Intent(this, OAuthActivity.class);
intent.putExtra(OAuthActivity.EXTRA_OAUTH_CONFIG, config);
startActivityForResult(intent, 1);
```

If everything goes fine, an external web browser will open Liferay's login page and will ask the credentials to the user.

Once user has sucessfully authenticated and granted permission to your app, the `onActivityResult` method in your `Activity` will be called. Likewise, if the user hasn't granted permission or something went wrong, `onActivityResult` will be also called:

```java
@Override
	public void onActivityResult(int request, int result, Intent intent) {
		if (result == RESULT_OK) {
			OAuthConfig config = (OAuthConfig)intent.getSerializableExtra(
				OAuthActivity.EXTRA_OAUTH_CONFIG);

			String consumerKey = config.getConsumerKey();
			String consumerSecret = config.getConsumerSecret();
			String token = config.getToken();
			String tokenSecret = config.getTokenSecret();
			
			// Create an OAuth instance with these values and pass to
			// the SessionImpl constructor
		}
		else if (result == RESULT_CANCELED) {
			Exception exception = (Exception)intent.getSerializableExtra(
				OAuthActivity.EXTRA_EXCEPTION);
	
			exception.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
```

Check the `result` parameter to see if authentication was sucessful or not. If successful, get the `OAuthConfig` extra from the intent, it provides all 4 values required by `SessionImpl` to authenticate against Liferay's remote services. Read the [use](#use) section above to learn how use the Mobile SDK's  services with these values.

In case of failure, the intent will contain a `Exception` extra with the error cause.
